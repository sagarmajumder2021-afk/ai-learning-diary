# Week 1: GitHub Automation & Contribution Strategy

**Date**: October 31, 2025  
**Topic**: Building Sustainable GitHub Contribution Habits

---

## 🎯 Key Learnings

### 1. GitHub Actions for Daily Automation
Discovered how to maintain consistent contributions using GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Auto Commit
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 5 * * *'  # Daily at 10:30 AM IST
jobs:
  auto-commit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: echo "$(date)" >> daily-log.txt
      - run: git add . && git commit -m "Daily update" && git push
```

**Why it matters**: Consistency beats intensity. One commit daily = 365 contributions yearly.

---

### 2. Strategic Repository Organization
Learned to organize repos by purpose:
- **Automation repos**: auto-green, daily-progress
- **Project repos**: ai-resume-analyzer, ClimateAI-Assistant
- **Learning repos**: ai-learning-diary, daily-scripts
- **Portfolio repos**: portfolio-website, profile README

**Insight**: Clear organization = easier maintenance and better showcase.

### 3. Daily Task Batching
Breaking down contributions into daily themes:
- **Monday**: Documentation
- **Tuesday**: Exploration
- **Wednesday**: Community
- **Thursday**: Experimentation
- **Friday**: Learning
- **Saturday**: Automation
- **Sunday**: Reflection

**Result**: No decision fatigue, clear daily focus.
